# CPS5981_Lab3

This repository contains three code files that were manually reviewed for issues, and then reviewed using automated static analysis tools (Fortify on Demand and Snyk.io). The procedure, results, and comparisons between these static analysis techniques are written in my Software Assurance class's lab report format, located in this GitHub repository in the form of a PDF document.
